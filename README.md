# 📚 শিকারি কবি হলে কি লিখতো?

Welcome to **শিকারি কবি হলে কি লিখতো?** – a poetry book app where sarcasm meets Bangla poetry. This isn't your average "ফুল, চাঁদ, তারা" kinda vibe – here the hunter (শিকারি) spills verses sharper than arrows. And guess what? It's built with **Angular** – because why not add some extra spice?

## 🏹 What is this?

An interactive digital poetry book where you navigate through pages filled with Bangla poems. Each page is a custom Angular component because shikaris like their poems well-organized and ready to fire.

## 🎯 Features

- **Dynamic Pages:** Every poem lives in its own Angular component – because each verse deserves the spotlight.
- **Bangla Support:** Yup, full-on Bangla goodness without breaking a sweat.
- **Navigation:** Go back and forth through the poems like a pro hunter tracking prey.
- **Animation Magic:** Smooth page transitions with the elegance of a shikari on the prowl.

## 🔧 Setup & Run

Wanna run this poetry madness? Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo (no actual hunting required):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/shikari-kobi.git
   cd shikari-poems
   ```

2. Install dependencies (it’s easier than catching a fish):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Launch the app (cue the poetic drumroll):

   ```bash
   pnpm ng serve
   ```

4. Open your browser and hit:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

## 📖 Adding New Poems

1. Create a new Angular component for your poem (because poems deserve their own space):

   ```bash
   pnpm ng generate component pages/your-poem-name
   ```

2. Import your component into the main poetry book and add it to the page list.

## 🧐 Why Angular?

Because when a shikari builds an app, they don’t settle for less. Plus, who doesn’t love a good component tree, right?
