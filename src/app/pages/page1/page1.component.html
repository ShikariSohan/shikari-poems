    <div class="line">If permitted to tell lies,</div>
    <div class="line">I'll say I don't want you,</div>
    <div class="line">Blindly, deny the love for you.</div>
    <div class="line">Yet my heart shall whisper the truth,</div>
    <div class="line">Silent melodies are only meant for you.</div>
